`sprig_cover.f3d` is the Fusion 360 file for the back cover. The back covers can be secured with M2 x 10mm screws and hex nuts.

<!-- todo: finish other side -->

If you choose to fabricate the back covers using a laser cutter, you'll need 2 pieces which are `sprig_cover--dpad.dxf` and `sprig_cover--solid.dxf`. One piece has a d-pad cutout for the buttons. It's designed to be cut out of 1/8" or 3mm acrylic.

`sprig_cover.stl` is the STL file for the back cover if you'd like to 3D print it.
